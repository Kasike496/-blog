<p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif ;">In order to keep fit and healthy, you should first have a weekly workout routine. <br>
    You can either workout in early in the morning or late in the evening. This depends on your daily schedule.
    <br>As for me, i prefer working out in the evening to refresh my mind after a tiring day. <i>What about you!</i>
    <br>Secondly, each day should have a different type of training to strengthen the whole body.<br>
     <br>Additionally, rest is  important in your workout routine. In a week you should have one or two rest days for muscles to <b>recover</b> and <b>grow</b>.
</p>
<h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">Example of a 6 day workout routine</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Monday: chest and <i>light</i> triceps</li>
    <li>Tuesday: back and <i>light</i> biceps</li>
    <li>Wednesday: rest day and optional core workout</li>
    <li>Thursday: shoulders and <i>heavy</i> triceps</li>
    <li>Friday: Leg and abs workout</li>
    <li>Saturday: Cardio exercises</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p><b>Always remember that if you still look good at the end of your workouts, you didn't train hard enough</b></p>
